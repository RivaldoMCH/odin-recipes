    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> <em>Fish and chips</em> traditional British dish consisting of fried fish and thinly sliced fried potatoes. The potatoes are called "French fries" in the U.S. and "chips" in the U.K. Many food historians think the first fish and chips shop was opened by Joseph Malin, a young Jewish immigrant, in London in the 1860s. His shop was so popular, it remained open until the 1970s.</p><br>
